# Portfolio
Third Year Module, task was to research an assigned topic in mathemtical software, write a report, and deliver a presemtation. 
My topic was the method of lines (MOL) which is a type of finite difference scheme used to approximate partial differential equations.
We worked in groups of two, I handled the mathematical treatment and worked examples for the final report. 

The main result from the module was that using the finite difference method, I solved Fourier's heat equation for the heating of a bucket of sand by an element placed in its center. This result was then compared to experimental data for the same setup I had from another module, and the conductivity of the sand determined.

In the repository, you can see a few videos from some easier examples I used in the presentation. The final report we submitted on the topic, as well as the C++ code used for the 
simulation of the sand experiment.
